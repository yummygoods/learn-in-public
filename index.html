    <p>Today I learned:</p>
    <p>That I need to get my fingers into some Actual Code every day. Like for real. And I don't mean <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> (that's 'Code-<em>CADEMY</em>' not 'Code-ACADEMY') or <a href="https://replit.com/~">Replit</a>, as much as I love them.</p> 
    <p>I need to get into <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VScode</a> and practice Doing The Thing.</p>
    <p>So. How about I start posting (daily-ish) about what I'm learning. 
        Like, implementing WHAT I'M LEARNING right there in the post.</p>
        <p>Maybe I'll keep pages separate with separate CSS files to show the progression? 
        Like a page of posts with its own CSS per week to start? And then per month? </p>
        <p>I'll wing it. I mean obviously.</p>
        <h4>blog will be <a href="blog.html">here</a></h4>
        <h5>nerd note: with that line above I just linked a second html page for the first time!</h5>
        
      <br>
        <p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
        <br>
        <h4>I did a bunch of stuff just putting this little thing together and it's already building my confidence.</h4>
       
        <ul>
            <li>In the terminal: 
                <ul> 
                    <li>created a new directory ('directory' is just tech-speak for folder) </li>
                    <li>navigated into directory an initialized a git repository</li>
                    <li>created a blank html file </li>
                    <li>created a blank css file</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    <br>
            <li>In VScode:
                    <ul>
                        <li>added boilerplate html</li>
                        <li>linked the CSS file to the html</li>
                        <li>used various html elements to create the content: headings, header, paragraph, unordered list, list items, anchor tags (links!), line breaks</li>
                        <br>
                     </ul>
            <li>Back in the terminal:</li>
                 <ul>
                    <li>checked status, listed contents</li>
                    <li>staged files for commit</li>
                    <li>committed files</li>
                 </ul> 
                 <br>
             <li>On GitHub:</li>
             <ul>
                <li>added new repo</li>
                <li>copied info to make it the remote for my local repository</li>
            </ul>
                <br>
            <li>Back in the terminal:</li>
                <ul>
                   <li>pasted info to create remote</li>
                   <li>pushed files to remote</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>Back on Github, double checked to see that it worked - and it did!</li>
             </ul> 
             <br>
             <h2>Come hang out with me as I figure this stuff out. <a href="https://github.com/yummygoods/learn-in-public">Here's</a> the link to this project on GitHub!</h2>
             <p>Someday soon this won't look like a website from 1994, I promise you.</p>
