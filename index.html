    <p>Today I learned:</p>
    <p>That I need to get my fingers into some Actual Code every day. Like for real. And I don't mean <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> (that's 'Code-<em>CADEMY</em>' not 'Code-ACADEMY') or <a href="https://replit.com/~">Replit</a>, as much as I love them.</p> 
    <p>I need to get into <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VScode</a> and practice Doing The Thing.</p>
    <p>So. How about I start posting (daily-ish) about what I'm learning. 
        <p>Like, implementing WHAT I'M LEARNING right there in the post.</p>
        <p>Maybe I'll keep pages separate with separate CSS files to show the progression? </p>
        <p>Like a page of posts with its own CSS per week to start? And then per month? </p>
        <p>I'll wing it. I mean obviously. </p>
      
        <p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>

        <p>just putting this little thing together is already building my confidence.</p>
        <p>Things I did for this: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>used the terminal to create a new directory ('directory' is just tech-speak for folder)</li>
            <br>
            <li>navigated into it an initialized a git repository</li>
            <br>
            <li>created a blank html file </li>
            <br>
            <li>created a blank css file</li>
            <br>
            <li>then in vs code, i added some boilerplate html</li>
            <br>
            <li>linked the CSS file to the html</li>
            <br>
            <li>used various html elements: headings, header, paragraph, unordered list, list items, anchor tags (links!)</li>
            <br>
            <li>ok</li>
            <br>
             <li>but now i'm super tired</li>
             <br>
             <li>and i need to catch some z's</li>

    </ul>
